Subject: WinBus Utility – Performance Support Platform for Infrastructure & IT Operations

Hi Team,

I’m sharing a quick overview of the WinBus Utility platform and its primary purpose.

The main intention of this product is to help Infrastructure teams and working IT agents proactively assist users by improving and monitoring Windows system performance in a controlled, support-friendly way.

Key product capabilities:

1) Guided Windows Optimization (Consent-Based)
- Step-by-step execution with user confirmation before each module.
- Safety-first approach with restore point creation before deep changes.
- Telemetry, cache cleanup, startup audit, and watchdog monitoring modules.

2) IT Support-Focused Operations
- Clear build and release workflows (EXE/MSI).
- L1/L2 support runbooks and troubleshooting guidance.
- Repeatable scripts and task-based operations for support engineers.

3) Centralized Remote Monitoring
- Endpoint status publishing from each client machine.
- Event and heartbeat tracking for multi-device visibility.
- Logs for startup audit, watchdog alerts, and remote transport events.

4) Scalable Monitoring Architecture
- Modular monitoring backend (Contracts/Core/Infrastructure/API).
- Split-service design: write ingestion API and read query API.
- SQL Server provider support for production persistence.
- Vue 3 dashboard for fleet-level visibility and incident triage.

5) Deployment Flexibility
- Native Windows deployment via EXE/MSI.
- IIS-hostable API services.
- Docker Compose stack for quick full-stack deployment (API, Query API, SQL, UI).

Business/Operational value:
- Faster issue triage and reduced endpoint performance complaints.
- Better visibility for infrastructure teams across multiple systems.
- Standardized and auditable optimization operations.
- Future-ready architecture that can evolve to support additional OS agents while keeping centralized monitoring contracts consistent.

If helpful, I can also provide:
- A short executive summary version,
- A customer-facing announcement version,
- And a technical deployment-focused version for operations handoff.
